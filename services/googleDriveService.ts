/**
 * Simulates uploading a file to the user's Google Drive.
 * In a real application, this would involve:
 * 1. Getting an access token from the user (via OAuth flow).
 * 2. Making an API call to the Google Drive API (gapi) from the client,
 *    or preferably, sending the file to your backend which then uses a service
 *    account or the user's token to upload the file.
 *
 * This simulation mimics the backend approach for better security and architecture.
 *
 * @param file - The file blob to be "uploaded".
 * @param fileName - The desired name for the file in Google Drive.
 * @returns A promise that resolves with a simulated file ID and web link.
