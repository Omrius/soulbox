        {
          "q": "Is the voice cloning truly realistic?",
          "a": "Yes. We use state-of-the-art technology that analyzes intonation, rhythm, and timbre from just a few minutes of recording. The result is a natural and warm voice, designed to capture the essence of the person, not for deception."
        },
        {
          "q": "How does the 'multisig' vault security work?",
          "a": "Your vault is protected by a 'secret sharing' system. Instead of a single key, access is split into several fragments distributed to your guardians. A set number of guardians must collaborate to reassemble the key. No one, not even SoulBox, can access it alone."
        },
        {
          "q": "How does SoulBox verify a death before releasing messages?",
          "a": "The process is initiated by a designated beneficiary. Then, the guardians you've chosen must independently confirm the situation. We can also integrate verification via official documents to ensure no premature release occurs."
        },
        {
          "q": "What happens to my data after I pass away?",
          "a": "You remain the owner of your data. In your directives, you can appoint a 'digital executor' to oversee your legacy. The clone and its contents are frozen and can no longer be modified, ensuring your wishes are respected to the letter."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I use SoulBox while I'm alive, for instance, if I lose the ability to speak?",
          "a": "Absolutely. SoulBox can serve as an assistive communication tool. If a person loses their ability to speak, their voice clone can allow them to continue communicating with loved ones, providing a familiar and comforting presence in difficult times."
